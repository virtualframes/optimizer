"""
mission_thread.py: Per-Namespace Orchestration.

This module allows for the logical separation of orchestration flows into
"mission threads." Each thread can have its own configuration, resources, and
security context, effectively acting as a namespaced instance of the PsiKernel.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Namespacing:** Isolate tasks and resources into logical threads to prevent interference.
2.  **Context Management:** Manage the configuration and state for each mission thread.
3.  **Scoped Orchestration:** Provide an entry point to the PsiKernel that is pre-configured for a specific mission thread.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- A configuration system for defining mission threads.
- Integration with Kubernetes namespaces or similar isolation mechanisms.
- Modifications to the PsiKernel to be aware of the current mission thread.
