# flaw_first_optimizer/psi_kernel.py

"""
psi_kernel.py: The Root Orchestrator and Fallback Resolver.

This module is the heart of the Flaw-First Optimization Engine. It is responsible for:
1.  **Orchestrating** the execution of tasks across different agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.).
2.  **Resolving fallbacks** when an agent fails or a mutation score is below a certain threshold.
3.  **Coordinating** with other core modules like the `agent_router`, `mutation_anchor`, and `reroute_traceback` to ensure a resilient and auditable system.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will include:
- A state machine for managing task execution.
- Integration with the `agent_router` to select the appropriate agent.
- Logic for triggering fallbacks and reroutes.
- Hooks for the `mutation_anchor` to fingerprint every operation.
