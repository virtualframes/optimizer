"""
entropy_injector.py: Inject Resilience into Agents.

This module addresses the "brittleness" of deterministic systems. By injecting
controlled, bounded randomness (entropy) into the agentic process, the system can
discover more robust solutions and avoid getting stuck in logic loops.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Bounded Randomness:** Introduce randomness in a controlled way, for example, by slightly modifying prompts or trying an unexpected agent.
2.  **Resilience Testing:** Proactively inject entropy to test the resilience of the system and identify hidden flaws.
3.  **Breaking Loops:** When a potential infinite loop is detected by the `reroute_traceback` module, use entropy to break the cycle.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will include:
- Different strategies for entropy injection (e.g., prompt mutation, random agent selection).
- Configuration to control the amount of entropy.
- Integration with the PsiKernel to be triggered under specific conditions.
