"""
audittrailwriter.py: Log to Neo4j + MinIO.

This module is responsible for writing a comprehensive, immutable audit trail
of all system activities. It ensures that every significant event is logged
to both a graph database (for relationship analysis) and object storage (for
long-term archival).

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Dual Logging:** Write event data to both Neo4j (via `Neo4jMapper`) and MinIO (or another S3-compatible store).
2.  **Event Serialization:** Define a standard format for audit log entries.
3.  **Immutability:** Ensure that once an audit entry is written, it cannot be changed. This might involve techniques like object versioning in MinIO.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- Integration with `Neo4jMapper`.
- An S3 client library (like `boto3` or `minio`).
- A system-wide hook to capture all auditable events.
