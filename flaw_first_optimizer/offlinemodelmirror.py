"""
offlinemodelmirror.py: Mirror spaCy/Blackstone Packs.

This module is responsible for managing local mirrors of external NLP models
and packages. This is essential for operating in an air-gapped environment
and for ensuring deterministic, reproducible results.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Model Downloading:** Provide scripts to download and store NLP models (like those from spaCy or Hugging Face) and other dependencies.
2.  **Local Loading:** Provide a unified interface to load these models from the local mirror instead of from the internet.
3.  **Versioning:** Keep track of the versions of all mirrored assets to ensure reproducibility.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation would require:
- Scripts to automate the download process (e.g., using `spacy download`).
- A well-defined directory structure for storing the mirrored assets.
- Configuration files to map model names to their local paths.
