"""
benchmark_runner.py: Score Latency, Reroute Depth.

This module is responsible for running benchmarks on the agentic system's
performance. It measures key metrics to ensure the system is operating
efficiently and to identify regressions or areas for improvement.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Metric Collection:** Gather data on latency, reroute depth, mutation success rates, and other performance indicators.
2.  **Scoring:** Calculate benchmark scores based on the collected metrics.
3.  **Reporting:** Store benchmark results and generate reports to track performance over time.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- Integration with the PsiKernel to hook into task execution.
- A data store (e.g., Prometheus, MinIO) for time-series metrics.
- A framework for defining and running different benchmark suites.
