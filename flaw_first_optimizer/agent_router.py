"""
agent_router.py: Claude/GPT/Gemini Reroute Logic.

This module is responsible for selecting the appropriate agent for a given task
and for handling rerouting logic when a fallback is triggered.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Agent Selection:** Choose the best agent based on task type, historical performance, and current availability.
2.  **Rerouting:** When an agent fails, select the next best agent to attempt the task.
3.  **Load Balancing:** Distribute tasks among agents to optimize for cost, latency, and quality.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will include:
- A registry of available agents and their capabilities.
- A scoring system to rank agents for a given task.
- Logic to prevent infinite reroute loops.
