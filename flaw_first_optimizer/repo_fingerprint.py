"""
repo_fingerprint.py: Anchor Repo State Before/After Mutation.

This module is responsible for creating a "fingerprint" of the entire
repository's state at a specific point in time. This is crucial for
benchmarking, as it allows for a precise comparison of the codebase
before and after a mutation.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **State Hashing:** Generate a hash of the entire repository content, ignoring irrelevant files (like `.git` or build artifacts).
2.  **State Anchoring:** Store this fingerprint in the audit trail, linking it to the mutation that is about to happen or has just happened.
3.  **State Comparison:** Provide a way to compare two fingerprints to confirm that only expected changes have occurred.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation would require:
- A fast hashing algorithm.
- File system traversal logic that respects `.gitignore` rules.
- Integration with the `MutationAnchor` to store the fingerprints.
