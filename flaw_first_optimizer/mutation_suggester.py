"""
mutation_suggester.py: Suggest Rewrites Based on Repo Drift.

This module analyzes the history of mutations in a repository to identify
"repo drift"â€”patterns of repeated, similar changes that suggest a deeper
architectural issue. It can then suggest larger-scale refactorings or
mutations to address the root cause.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Drift Analysis:** Analyze the mutation history (from Neo4j) to find patterns and hotspots of frequent changes.
2.  **Suggestion Generation:** Propose new, more comprehensive mutations to address the identified drift.
3.  **Refactoring Planning:** Outline the steps required for a suggested refactoring.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- Integration with `Neo4jMapper` to query mutation history.
- An analysis engine to detect patterns in code changes.
- An AI agent to generate high-level refactoring plans.
