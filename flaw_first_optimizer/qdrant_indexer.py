"""
qdrant_indexer.py: Semantic Memory.

This module provides an interface to a Qdrant vector database for storing
and retrieving semantic information. This allows the system to have a "memory"
of past tasks, solutions, and documents, enabling semantic search and context
retrieval.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Vectorization:** Convert text (prompts, code, documents) into numerical vectors using an embedding model.
2.  **Indexing:** Store these vectors in a Qdrant collection for efficient similarity search.
3.  **Retrieval:** Provide a method to search for relevant information given a query vector.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- The `qdrant-client` Python package.
- An embedding model (e.g., from `sentence-transformers`).
- Connection handling for the Qdrant database.
