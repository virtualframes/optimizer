"""
pr_simulator.py: Simulate PR Merges, Detect Conflicts.

This module provides tools to simulate the impact of a pull request (PR)
before it is merged. It can detect potential merge conflicts, run tests against
the proposed changes, and predict the likelihood of the PR causing a regression.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Conflict Detection:** Simulate a `git merge` operation to see if a PR would cause merge conflicts.
2.  **Impact Analysis:** Analyze the code changes to determine which parts of the codebase are affected.
3.  **Test Simulation:** Run relevant tests against the would-be merged code in a temporary environment.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation would require:
- Git libraries (like `GitPython`) to interact with a repository.
- A testing framework to run tests programmatically.
- A static analysis engine to understand code dependencies.
