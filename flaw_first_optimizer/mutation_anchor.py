"""
mutation_anchor.py: Fingerprint Every Rewrite.

This module is responsible for creating a permanent, auditable record of every
mutation made by the agentic system. A "mutation" can be a code change, a
configuration update, or any other significant action.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Fingerprinting:** Generate a unique, deterministic fingerprint for every mutation. This could be a hash of the code diff, a timestamp, and agent metadata.
2.  **Anchoring:** Store this fingerprint and associated metadata in a secure, immutable storage layer (like Neo4j or a MinIO bucket).
3.  **Auditing:** Provide an interface to retrieve mutation history for auditing, replay, or rollback.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will include:
- A robust fingerprinting algorithm.
- Integration with a graph database (Neo4j) to store the lineage of mutations.
- An API for the PsiKernel to call after every successful mutation.
