# flaw_first_optimizer/dev_ui.py

"""
dev_ui.py: Unified Interface for PRs, Docs, Memory.

This module provides a developer-facing user interface (likely a CLI or a
simple web app) to interact with the Flaw-First Optimization Engine. It serves
as a single pane of glass for managing mutations, viewing audit trails, and
interacting with the system's memory.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **PR Management:** Interface with the `pr_simulator` to test and manage pull requests.
2.  **Memory Search:** Provide a way to query the `QdrantIndexer` for semantic information.
3.  **Audit Trail Viewing:** Allow developers to view mutation histories using the `RerouteReplay` module.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation would require:
- A CLI framework (like `click` or `argparse`).
- Integration with all the core modules of the system to expose their functionality.
