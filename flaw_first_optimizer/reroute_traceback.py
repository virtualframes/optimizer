"""
reroute_traceback.py: Simulate Fallback Paths.

This module is a critical component for ensuring system resilience. It's responsible
for simulating and analyzing fallback paths to prevent infinite loops and predict
potential failures.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Path Simulation:** Before executing a reroute, simulate the potential path to identify cycles (e.g., Claude -> GPT -> Claude).
2.  **Depth Scoring:** Calculate a score for reroute depth. Too many reroutes for a single task can indicate a deeper problem.
3.  **Failure Prediction:** Analyze historical reroute data to predict the likelihood of success for a given fallback path.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will include:
- A graph-based representation of agent connections.
- Algorithms to detect cycles and score path complexity.
- Integration with the PsiKernel to gate rerouting decisions.
