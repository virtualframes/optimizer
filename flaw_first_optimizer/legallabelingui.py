"""
legallabelingui.py: Active Learning Loop.

This module provides a user interface for human-in-the-loop labeling of
legal documents. This is crucial for creating the ground-truth datasets needed
by `benchmarks.py` and for fine-tuning models via active learning.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **UI for Labeling:** Present extracted text or entities to a user and allow them to label them (e.g., "Is this a valid citation?").
2.  **Active Learning:** Intelligently select the most informative documents for a human to label, in order to improve model performance most efficiently.
3.  **Data Persistence:** Store the human-provided labels in a database.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation would require:
- A web framework (like Flask or FastAPI) to serve the UI.
- A frontend component (e.g., using HTML/CSS/JS).
- A database for storing labeled data.
