"""
neo4j_mapper.py: Anchor Graph Lineage.

This module provides an interface to a Neo4j database to store the lineage
of all agentic operations. It creates a graph where nodes can be mutations,
agents, tasks, or code artifacts, and relationships represent their interactions.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Graph Mapping:** Define the schema for how agentic system data is represented in a graph.
2.  **Data Persistence:** Provide methods to create, update, and query nodes and relationships in Neo4j.
3.  **Lineage Tracking:** Ensure that every mutation is linked to its cause, its author (agent), and its outcome.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- The `neo4j` Python driver.
- Connection handling for the Neo4j database.
- Cypher queries for all CRUD operations.
