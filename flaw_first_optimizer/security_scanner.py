"""
security_scanner.py: CVE + SBOM + Cosign.

This module integrates security scanning into the agentic workflow. It's
responsible for scanning dependencies for vulnerabilities, generating Software
Bill of Materials (SBOMs), and verifying software signatures.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools like Grype or Trivy to scan container images and dependencies for known CVEs.
2.  **SBOM Generation:** Create SBOMs in formats like SPDX or CycloneDX to provide a full inventory of software components.
3.  **Signature Verification:** Use tools like Cosign to verify the signatures of container images and other artifacts, ensuring they haven't been tampered with.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- Wrapper scripts to execute external scanning tools (Grype, Syft, Cosign).
- Logic to parse the output of these tools.
- Integration with the CI/CD pipeline to gate deployments on security posture.
