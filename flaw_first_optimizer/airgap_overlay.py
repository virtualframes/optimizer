"""
airgap_overlay.py: Zero Egress, Sealed Secrets.

This module provides a layer of security to ensure that the agentic system
can operate in an air-gapped environment with no external network access,
or with strictly controlled egress points.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **Egress Control:** Act as a proxy for all outbound network requests, blocking or allowing them based on a strict policy.
2.  **Sealed Secrets:** Manage secrets (API keys, credentials) in a way that they are encrypted at rest and only decrypted in memory when needed.
3.  **Dependency Mirroring:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies (packages, models) are mirrored locally to avoid external calls.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- A network proxy component.
- Integration with a secret management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Sealed Secrets).
- A local package repository (e.g., a private PyPI server).
