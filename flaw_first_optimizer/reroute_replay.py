"""
reroute_replay.py: Replay Mutation Ancestry.

This module allows the system to replay the entire history of a mutation,
including all agent interactions, reroutes, and tool calls. This is essential
for debugging, auditing, and understanding the evolution of the system.

Core responsibilities:
1.  **History Retrieval:** Query the `Neo4jMapper` to retrieve the full lineage of a given mutation fingerprint.
2.  **State Reconstruction:** Reconstruct the state of the system at each step of the mutation's history.
3.  **Simulation:** "Replay" the sequence of events in a simulated environment to understand how a particular outcome was reached.

This is a placeholder scaffold. The full implementation will require:
- Tight integration with the `Neo4jMapper` to traverse the graph.
- A simulation environment to execute historical actions without side effects.
