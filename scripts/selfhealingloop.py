# FLAWMODE: Self-Healing Loop
# This script defines the core logic for the agent's self-healing process.
# It orchestrates the full cycle:
# 1. Trace the failure (receive a flaw trace).
# 2. Generate a patch to correct the flaw.
# 3. Benchmark the patch for effectiveness and clarity.
# 4. Anchor the entire process in memory for future learning.
