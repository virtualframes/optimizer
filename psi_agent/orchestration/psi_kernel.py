"""
Placeholder for the Psi-Kernel, the root orchestrator of the system.

The Psi-Kernel is the central nervous system of the psi_agent architecture.
It is responsible for initializing all subsystems, managing the main event
loop, and orchestrating the flow of information between the scanner,
synthesizer, benchmarker, and auto-aligner. It also handles critical,
low-level functions like circuit breaking and graceful degradation in response
to multi-vendor failures.
