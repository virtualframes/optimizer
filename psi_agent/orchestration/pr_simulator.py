"""
A conceptual simulator for the pull request and merge process.

This module acts as an abstraction layer over the version control system (e.g., Git).
It is responsible for taking a proposed code mutation from the MutationEngine,
packaging it into a pull request, running automated checks (like linting and
unit tests), and simulating the merge process. This ensures that all self-healing
changes are subject to the same quality gates as human-generated code, providing
a crucial layer of safety and auditability.
