"""
Placeholder for the Forensic Fingerprinting module.

This module is responsible for generating deterministic fingerprints (hashes)
for various types of data, including raw scraped content, source code modules,
and agent-generated mutations. These fingerprints are crucial for ensuring
data integrity, tracking lineage, and enabling auditable, replayable event
sequences in the system's memory.
