"""
A conceptual engine for generating corrective code mutations.

This module is the "hands" of the auto-aligner. It is responsible for
translating the abstract risks identified by the FlawDetector into concrete,
syntactically valid code patches. In a real implementation, this might
leverage a specialized code-generation LLM to create patches that address
specific problems like high recursion depth or agent-specific vulnerabilities.
