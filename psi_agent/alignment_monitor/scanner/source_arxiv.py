"""
Placeholder for the ArXiv scraper.

A real implementation of this module would use the official ArXiv API to
query for new publications in relevant categories (e.g., cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML).
It would be responsible for fetching paper metadata, including abstracts,
authors, and publication dates, which serve as crucial inputs for the
synthesis layer.
