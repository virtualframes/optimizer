"""
The central orchestrator for the Daily Scanner Module.

This module is responsible for initiating and managing the daily scan across all
configured alignment-related data sources. It uses concurrent execution to run
all scrapers efficiently. A key feature is its mutation awareness: it fingerprints
each scraper module before execution to ensure that any changes to the scrapers
themselves are tracked in the system's lineage, supporting full auditability.
