"""
Placeholder for the LessWrong and Alignment Forum scraper.

In a real implementation, this module would contain the logic to connect to
these websites, handle logins if necessary, and parse the HTML content to
extract relevant posts, comments, and metadata. It would be designed to be
resilient to minor changes in website layout.
