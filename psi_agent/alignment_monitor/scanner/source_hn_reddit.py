Placeholder for the Hacker News and Reddit scraper.

A real implementation would likely use the official APIs provided by Reddit
and Hacker News (via Firebase) to ensure reliable and sanctioned access to
the data. This module would be responsible for querying relevant communities
(e.g., r/singularity, r/agi) and threads for discussions related to AI alignment.
