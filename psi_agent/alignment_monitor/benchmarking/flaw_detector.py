"""
The analytical component of the benchmarking system.

This module is responsible for analyzing the raw data from the BenchmarkExposer
to identify specific, actionable risks that could lead to system degradation or
entropy collapse. It applies a set of predefined heuristics and thresholds to
the benchmark report to detect patterns like high recursion depth, excessive
latency, or reliance on externally flagged agents. Its output is the direct
trigger for the AutoAligner's mutation proposals.
