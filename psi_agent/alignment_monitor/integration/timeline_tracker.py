"""
A module for monitoring shifts in community consensus on AI timelines.

This component provides a longitudinal view of the intelligence gathered by the
system. It is responsible for querying the Neo4j graph database to track how
predictions and sentiment about AI alignment evolve over time. While the
AutoAligner responds to immediate, acute risks, the TimelineTracker is designed
to detect slower-moving, strategic shifts in the landscape, providing crucial
context for long-term governance of the psi_agent system.
